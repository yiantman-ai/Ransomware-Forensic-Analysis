# Malware File Hashes

**WARNING:** These hashes are for EDUCATIONAL MALWARE only.  
Do NOT use for malicious purposes.

## Source Code

**File:** malware/source_code/advanced_ransomware.py
```
SHA256: [Calculate after final version]
MD5: [Calculate after final version]
SHA1: [Calculate after final version]
```

## Compiled Binary

**File:** winupdate1095726858.exe (not in repository)
```
SHA256: [Would need actual compiled binary]
MD5: [Would need actual compiled binary]
SHA1: [Would need actual compiled binary]
Size: ~12 MB (compiled with PyInstaller)
```

## Encoded Payload

**File:** config.dat (Base64-encoded binary)
```
Size: 18,595,556 bytes (18.6 MB)
Format: Base64-encoded executable
SHA256: [Would need actual file]
```

## PowerShell Loader

**File:** loader.ps1
```
Size: 868 bytes
SHA256: [Would need actual file]
Content: PowerShell script to download and decode payload
```

## How to Calculate Hashes
```bash
# SHA256
sha256sum file.exe

# MD5
md5sum file.exe

# SHA1
sha1sum file.exe

# All at once
openssl dgst -sha256 -md5 -sha1 file.exe
```

## YARA Rule for Detection
```yara
rule Ransomware_Educational_Hash
{
    meta:
        description = "Detects educational ransomware by hash"
        author = "Jesse Antman"
        
    strings:
        // Add actual hashes here when available
        
    condition:
        filesize < 20MB
}
```

**Note:** Actual binary hashes would be added here if malware was compiled and distributed. This is educational material only.
